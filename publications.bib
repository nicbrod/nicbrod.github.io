abstract = {In chemoradiation therapy, the synergy between the radiation and the chemotherapeutic agent (CA) can result in a super-additive treatment. A priori, this increased effectiveness could be estimated from model calculations, if absolute cross sections (ACSs) involved in cellular damage are substantially higher, when the CA binds to DNA. We measure ACSs for damages induced by 10 eV electrons, when DNA binds to the CA cisplatin as in chemotherapy. At this energy, DNA is damaged essentially by the decay of core-excited transient anions into bond-breaking channels. Films of cisplatin-DNA complexes of ratio 5:1 with thicknesses 10, 15, and 20 nm were irradiated in vacuum during 5-30 s. Conformation changes were quantified by electrophoresis and yields extrapolated from exposure-response curves. Base damages (BDs) were revealed and quantified by enzymatic treatment. The ACSs were generated from these yields by two mathematical models. For 3197 base-pair plasmid DNA, ACS for single strand breaks, double strand breaks (DSBs), crosslinks, non-DSB cluster damages, and total BDs is 71 ± 2, 9.3 ± 0.4, 10.1 ± 0.3, 8.2 ± 0.3, and 115 ± 2 ×10-15 cm2, respectively. These ACSs are higher than those of nonmodified DNA by factors of 1.6 ± 0.1, 2.2 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.3, and 2.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Since LEEs are produced in large quantities by radiolysis and strongly interact with biomolecules, we expect such enhancements to produce substantial additional damages in the DNA of the nucleus of cancer cells during concomitant chemoradiation therapy. The increase damage appears sufficiently large to justify more elaborate simulations, which could provide a quantitative evaluation of molecular sensitization by Pt-CAs.},

abstract = {This work describes multiple experimental improvements for measuring absolute cross sections of DNA damage induced by low-energy electrons in nanometer-thick films in vacuum. Measurements of such cross sections are particularly sensitive to film thickness and uniformity. Using atomic force microscopy in 70% ethanol, we present a novel and effective method to determine plasmid DNA film thickness and uniformity that combines height histograms and force-distance curves. We also investigate film deposition with DNA intercalated with 1,3-diaminopropane (Dap) on tantalum-coated substrates as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to the previously-used graphite substrate. The tantalum substrate permits deposition of films very similar to those formed on graphite. Using these refinements and further optimizations of the experimental procedure, we measure an absolute cross section of (7.4 ± 2.3) × 10-18 cm2 per nucleotide for conformational damage to a 3197 base-pair plasmid, induced by 10 eV electrons, which we believe should be considered as a reference value.},

abstract = {Complex living systems, such as the human organism, are characterized by their self-organized and dissipative behaviors, where irreversible processes continuously produce entropy internally and export it to the environment; however, a means by which to measure human entropy production and entropy flow over time is not well-studied. In this article, we leverage prior experimental data to introduce an experimental approach for the continuous measurement of external entropy flow (released to the environment) and internal entropy production (within the body), using direct and indirect calorimetry, respectively, for humans exercising under heat stress. Direct calorimetry, performed with a whole-body modified Snellen calorimeter, was used to measure the external heat dissipation from the change in temperature and relative humidity between the air outflow and inflow, from which was derived the rates of entropy flow of the body. Indirect calorimetry, which measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from inspired and expired gases, was used to monitor internal entropy production. A two-compartment entropy flow model was used to calculate the rates of internal entropy production and external entropy flow for 11 middle-aged men during a schedule of alternating exercise and resting bouts at a fixed metabolic heat production rate. We measured a resting internal entropy production rate of (0.18 ± 0.01) W/(K{\textperiodcentered}m2) during heat stress only, which is in agreement with published measurements. This research introduces an approach for the real-time monitoring of entropy production and entropy flow in humans, and aims for an improved understanding of human health and illness based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics.},
