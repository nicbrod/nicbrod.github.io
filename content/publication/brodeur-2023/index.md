abstract: Complex living systems, such as the human organism, are characterized by
  their self-organized and dissipative behaviors, where irreversible processes continuously
  produce entropy internally and export it to the environment; however, a means by
  which to measure human entropy production and entropy flow over time is not well-studied.
  In this article, we leverage prior experimental data to introduce an experimental
  approach for the continuous measurement of external entropy flow (released to the
  environment) and internal entropy production (within the body), using direct and
  indirect calorimetry, respectively, for humans exercising under heat stress. Direct
  calorimetry, performed with a whole-body modified Snellen calorimeter, was used
  to measure the external heat dissipation from the change in temperature and relative
  humidity between the air outflow and inflow, from which was derived the rates of
  entropy flow of the body. Indirect calorimetry, which measures oxygen consumption
  and carbon dioxide production from inspired and expired gases, was used to monitor
  internal entropy production. A two-compartment entropy flow model was used to calculate
  the rates of internal entropy production and external entropy flow for 11 middle-aged
  men during a schedule of alternating exercise and resting bouts at a fixed metabolic
  heat production rate. We measured a resting internal entropy production rate of
  (0.18 ± 0.01) W/(K˙m2) during heat stress only, which is in agreement with published
  measurements. This research introduces an approach for the real-time monitoring
  of entropy production and entropy flow in humans, and aims for an improved understanding
  of human health and illness based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
