 abstract = {In chemoradiation therapy, the synergy between the radiation and the chemotherapeutic agent (CA) can result in a super-additive treatment. A priori, this increased effectiveness could be estimated from model calculations, if absolute cross sections (ACSs) involved in cellular damage are substantially higher, when the CA binds to DNA. We measure ACSs for damages induced by 10 eV electrons, when DNA binds to the CA cisplatin as in chemotherapy. At this energy, DNA is damaged essentially by the decay of core-excited transient anions into bond-breaking channels. Films of cisplatin-DNA complexes of ratio 5:1 with thicknesses 10, 15, and 20 nm were irradiated in vacuum during 5-30 s. Conformation changes were quantified by electrophoresis and yields extrapolated from exposure-response curves. Base damages (BDs) were revealed and quantified by enzymatic treatment. The ACSs were generated from these yields by two mathematical models. For 3197 base-pair plasmid DNA, ACS for single strand breaks, double strand breaks (DSBs), crosslinks, non-DSB cluster damages, and total BDs is 71 ± 2, 9.3 ± 0.4, 10.1 ± 0.3, 8.2 ± 0.3, and 115 ± 2 ×10-15 cm2, respectively. These ACSs are higher than those of nonmodified DNA by factors of 1.6 ± 0.1, 2.2 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.3, and 2.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Since LEEs are produced in large quantities by radiolysis and strongly interact with biomolecules, we expect such enhancements to produce substantial additional damages in the DNA of the nucleus of cancer cells during concomitant chemoradiation therapy. The increase damage appears sufficiently large to justify more elaborate simulations, which could provide a quantitative evaluation of molecular sensitization by Pt-CAs.},
