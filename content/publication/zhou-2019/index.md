abstract: In chemoradiation therapy, the synergy between the radiation and the chemotherapeutic
  agent (CA) can result in a super-additive treatment. A priori, this increased effectiveness
  could be estimated from model calculations, if absolute cross sections (ACSs) involved
  in cellular damage are substantially higher, when the CA binds to DNA. We measure
  ACSs for damages induced by 10 eV electrons, when DNA binds to the CA cisplatin
  as in chemotherapy. At this energy, DNA is damaged essentially by the decay of core-excited
  transient anions into bond-breaking channels. Films of cisplatin-DNA complexes of
  ratio 5:1 with thicknesses 10, 15, and 20 nm were irradiated in vacuum during 5-30
  s. Conformation changes were quantified by electrophoresis and yields extrapolated
  from exposure-response curves. Base damages (BDs) were revealed and quantified by
  enzymatic treatment. The ACSs were generated from these yields by two mathematical
  models. For 3197 base-pair plasmid DNA, ACS for single strand breaks, double strand
  breaks (DSBs), crosslinks, non-DSB cluster damages, and total BDs is 71 ± 2, 9.3
  ± 0.4, 10.1 ± 0.3, 8.2 ± 0.3, and 115 ± 2 ×10-15 cm2, respectively. These ACSs are
  higher than those of nonmodified DNA by factors of 1.6 ± 0.1, 2.2 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.1,
  1.3 ± 0.3, and 2.1 ± 0.4, respectively. Since LEEs are produced in large quantities
  by radiolysis and strongly interact with biomolecules, we expect such enhancements
  to produce substantial additional damages in the DNA of the nucleus of cancer cells
  during concomitant chemoradiation therapy. The increase damage appears sufficiently
  large to justify more elaborate simulations, which could provide a quantitative
  evaluation of molecular sensitization by Pt-CAs.
