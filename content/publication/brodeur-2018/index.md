abstract: This work describes multiple experimental improvements for measuring absolute
  cross sections of DNA damage induced by low-energy electrons in nanometer-thick
  films in vacuum. Measurements of such cross sections are particularly sensitive
  to film thickness and uniformity. Using atomic force microscopy in 70% ethanol,
  we present a novel and effective method to determine plasmid DNA film thickness
  and uniformity that combines height histograms and force-distance curves. We also
  investigate film deposition with DNA intercalated with 1,3-diaminopropane (Dap)
  on tantalum-coated substrates as a convenient and cost-effective alternative to
  the previously-used graphite substrate. The tantalum substrate permits deposition
  of films very similar to those formed on graphite. Using these refinements and further
  optimizations of the experimental procedure, we measure an absolute cross section
  of (7.4 ± 2.3) × 10-18 cm2 per nucleotide for conformational damage to a 3197 base-pair
  plasmid, induced by 10 eV electrons, which we believe should be considered as a
  reference value.
